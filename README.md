- ### Design

    - Colour Scheme
        - The site is primarily monochrome, in black and white, with important
            features in bold colours. The central features of images are in colour against a black and white background.

    - Typography
        - The Quicksand font is used throughout, with basic Sans Serif as the fallback in case the font import fails. This font is simple and clean, and its rounded character reflects the friendly, informal nature of the information on the site.
    
    - Imagery
        - The hero image (of coins) has an overlay of another image (of ripples on water) which fades to a low opacity on page load. This evokes the experience of seeing coins at the bottom of a wishing well or fountain, which is reinforced by the user message on the homepage - 'Wish your bills were smaller?'
        - The images used for each tips are simple and unambiguous, with the central feature in each image being in colour against a backdrop of black and white, in order to provide emphasis.

## **Strategy**
#### Business Goal :
To draw visitors to the site
To showcase static web skills - HTML and CSS
#### User goal :
To inform casual visitors about easy ways to save money on their bills.
Tone should be light, helpful and non-preachy.

#### Trade-offs :

              background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, .2); 
              color: white;">
