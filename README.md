# **Less is More**

### A website that helps visitors save money in their home and in their car 

<hr>

## **Strategy**
#### Business Goal :
To draw visitors to the site
To showcase static web skills - HTML and CSS
#### User goal :
To inform casual visitors about easy ways to save money on their bills.
Tone should be light, helpful and non-preachy.

#### Trade-offs :
<table style="border: 1px solid black; 
              background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0, .2); 
              color: white;">
    <tr>
        <th>Opportunity</th>
        <th>Importance</th>
        <th>Feasibility</th>
        <th>Comments</th>

        <td>21</td>
